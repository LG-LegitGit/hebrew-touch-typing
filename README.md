### Key Adjustments:
- **Prominence**: I added a specific "Keyboard Layout Requirement" section to emphasize its importance. I've put it in bold text for better visibility.
- **Clarity**: The wording has been adjusted slightly to make the requirement clear and obvious. 

This should make it easier for users to notice the importance of switching to the Hebrew keyboard layout before using the application. If you have any further changes or suggestions, feel free to share!
